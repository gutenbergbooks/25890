		<h2 class="title">Psychometry: The Divine Science.</h2>
		<p><span class="first_word">It</span> is presumed that every reader of these pages has some knowledge
		of this subject, either by reading the “Manual of Psychometry”
		or otherwise, and has at least read the “Introduction to the <cite class="name">Journal
		of Man</cite>” on our cover pages.</p>

		<p>It is not of the directly practical bearings of Psychometry that I
		would speak at present, but of its imperial rank among sciences,
		entitling it to the post of honor.</p>

		<p>In all human affairs, that takes the highest rank which has the
		greatest controlling and guiding power. The king, the statesman,
		the hero, the saintly founder of a religion, the philosopher that
		guides the course of human thought, and the scientist who gives us
		a greater command of nature, are the men whom we honor as the
		ministers of destiny.</p>

		<p>When we speak of science, we accord the highest rank to that
		which gives the greatest comprehension of the world as it is—of its
		past and of its future. Geology and astronomy are the sciences
		which reach out into the illimitable alike in the present and past.
		Biology will do the same for the world of life when biology is
		completed by a knowledge of the centre of all life, the brain. But
		in its present acephalous condition it is but a fragment of science—a
		headless corpse, unfit to rank among complete sciences. Theology
		claims the highest rank of all, but based as it has been on the conceptions
		current in the dark ages, it has become, in the light of
		modern science, a crumbling ruin. Does psychometry compare with
		astronomy and geology in its scientific rank, or does it compare with
		the acephalous biology, which occupies all medical colleges?</p>

		<p>It compares with neither. Like astronomy, it borders on the
		limitless; like geology, it reaches into the vast, undefined past; and
		like biology, it comprehends all life science; but unlike each, it has
		no limitation to any sphere. It is equally at home with living forms
		and with dead matter—equally at home in the humbler spheres of
		human life and human infirmity, and in the higher spheres of the
		spirit world, which we call heaven. It grasps all of biology, all of
		history, all of geology and astronomy, and far more than
		telescopes have revealed. It has no parallel in any science, for
		sciences are limited and defined in their scope, while psychometry is
		unlimited, transcending far all that collegians have called science,
		and all that they have deemed the limits of human capacities, for in
		<a class="pagenum" id="page2" title="2"> </a>psychometry the divinity in man becomes apparent, and the intellectual
		mastery of all things lifts human life to a higher plane than it
		has ever known before.</p>

		<p>Psychometry is therefore in its nature and scope not classifiable
		among the sciences, since it reaches out above and beyond all, in a
		higher and broader sphere, and hence may truly be called the
		Divine science, for it is the expression of the Divine element in man.
		Wherein is Divine above human knowledge? And wherein is human
		above animal knowledge and understanding? The superiority
		in each case consists in a deeper and more interior comprehension
		of that which is, which realizes in the present the potentiality
		of the future, enabling us to act for future results and accomplish
		whatever is possible to our powers. That forecast, that comprehension
		through the present of that which is to be, constitutes
		foresight,—the essential element of wisdom; and in its grander
		manifestations it appears as prophecy. Prophecy, then, is the
		noblest aspect of psychometry; and if this prophetic power can be
		cultivated to its maximum possibilities, there is no reason why it
		should not become the guiding power of each individual life,
		and the guiding power for the destiny of nations. Moreover,
		in its prophetic role its superiority of rank is manifest, since it
		is then the instructor of all hearers,—the revealer of that in which
		they readily confess their ignorance.</p>

		<p>Hence it was that St. Paul especially recommended the cultivation
		of prophecy as the most sacred and Divine of all religious exercises,
		saying, in 1 Corinthians <abbr title="fourteen">xiv.</abbr> 21-25: “If therefore the
		whole church be come together into one place, and all speak
		with tongues, and there come in those who are unlearned or
		unbelievers, will they not say ye are mad? But <em>if all prophesy</em>,
		and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned,
		he is convinced of all, he is judged of all: and thus are the
		secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his
		face, he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.”
		This is a description of a congregation in which all are developed up
		to a psychometric and spiritual condition in which the truths of religion
		and the ministry of angels may have full power.</p>

		<p>Wherever the highest order of religious sentiment is in active
		operation, prophecy becomes one of its results. It was so in
		Jewish history, and has been so in many eventful periods since.</p>

		<p>George Fox had the most exalted religious sentiment of his time,
		and he had an eminently prophetic mind. All nations have had
		prophetic minds and well-attested prophecies. Egypt and India,
		Greece, Rome, France, England, and America, have their recorded
		prophecies, and in the height of ancient civilization prophecy commanded
		sufficient respect to influence the course of public events.
		Cicero expressed the general intelligence of the ancients in recognizing
		prophecy as a power of the human soul.</p>

		<p>Modern materialism has ignored all this, and one of the noblest
		works to-day for a man of genius whose mind is sufficiently vigorous
		to throw off the trammels of collegiate ignorance and fashionable
		<a class="pagenum" id="page3" title="3"> </a>conservatism, would be to produce a volume upon prophecy, in
		which its vast historic development should be sketched.</p>

		<p>The limitations of the <cite class="name">Journal of Man</cite> do not permit me to
		introduce this historic matter which would be sufficient to exclude
		everything else from its pages, and I would merely refer to an
		almost forgotten example of the intuitive and prescient faculty
		connected with the introduction of Universalism into this country.</p>

		<p>A worthy and pious farmer on the seacoast of Delaware, named
		Potter, built a church at his own expense, but having an advanced
		idea of the Divine benevolence, he could never find any preacher
		whose doctrines suited him. Nevertheless he was profoundly convinced
		that such a preacher would be sent to realize his hopes, and
		was not discouraged by the disbelief of his neighbors. His anticipation
		was strangely fulfilled. Rev. John Murray, almost crazed by
		the death of his wife, sailed from England for America in 1770,
		intending to abandon the pulpit entirely. The vessel put in at
		Philadelphia instead of New York, and as the stage for New York
		had left, Mr. Murray concluded to remain on the vessel and go to
		New York that way. But on the voyage they got lost in the fog,
		and got into Cranberry Inlet in a dangerous position. They went
		ashore, being out of provisions, and found a country tavern. Mr.
		Murray strolled along the coast, intending to get fish for the crew,
		and fell into company with Farmer Potter, who had a supply, and
		who at once told him, to his astonishment, that he was glad to meet
		him, and had been looking for him a long time. Potter decided at
		once that this was the minister he had been looking for, and of whom
		he had often spoken when telling his neighbors, “God will send me
		a preacher of a very different stamp from those who have heretofore
		preached in my house; that God who has put it into my heart to
		build this house will send one who shall deliver to me His own truth,
		who shall speak of Jesus Christ and His salvation.” Potter
		briefly sketched his own life and said:</p>

		<p>“The moment I beheld your vessel on shore, it seemed as if a
		voice had suddenly sounded in my ears: ‘There, Potter, in that
		vessel cast away on that shore is the preacher you have been so long
		expecting.’ I heard the voice and I believed the report; and when
		you came up to my door and asked for the fish, the same voice
		seemed to repeat, ‘Potter, this is the man, this is the person whom I
		have sent to preach in your house.’”</p>

		<p>Murray says: “I was astonished, immeasurably astonished at Mr.
		Potter’s narrative, but yet I had not the smallest idea that it could
		ever be realized. I requested to know what he could discover in my
		appearance which could lead him to mistake me for a preacher.”
		“What,” said he, “could I discover when you were in the vessel that
		could induce this conclusion? No sir, it is not what I saw or see,
		but what I feel, which produces in my mind a full conviction.”
		“But, my dear sir, you are deceived, indeed you are deceived. I
		shall never preach in this place nor anywhere else.”</p>

		<p>Potter maintained that he had preached and that he would preach
		in his church, and that the wind would not allow him to leave until
		<a class="pagenum" id="page4" title="4"> </a>he had. To shorten the story, Murray at last yielded and preached
		in that church, of which we have a picture in his biography. He
		had a great fear of giving out the doctrine of universal salvation,
		expecting universal denunciation of himself by the clergy and their
		followers, but he went on from this beginning and established
		Universalism in America.</p>

		<p>In this instance it is evident that Potter was of a spiritual
		temperament, and was indebted to a spirit influence for his impressions
		and convictions. But whatever is possible to the disembodied
		spirit in the intellectual way is also possible to the embodied spirit
		which has not lost its material body, if the interior faculties are well
		developed and prophecy does not require supernal aid. In innumerable
		cases mesmeric subjects, in their somniloquent condition,
		have made most accurate predictions in reference to their own cases
		and others, which have been accurately verified. There is probably
		no good clairvoyant physician who has not often made successful
		predictions concerning patients.</p>

		<p>In the daily practice of psychometry, Mrs. Buchanan, of whose
		powers the “Manual of Psychometry” gives a fair idea, is accustomed
		in speaking of the present to feel impressions of the past and
		the future. In reference to public men she has spoken in advance of
		their election or defeat, their policy and their death. She spoke
		prophetically of the election of Cleveland and the defeat of Blaine,
		of the deaths of Disraeli and Garibaldi, of the career of Gladstone
		and his becoming “the best friend of Ireland;” and when Ireland
		was believed to be on the brink of a bloody revolution or rebellion,
		she announced that no such outbreak would occur, but that at the
		end of two years Ireland would be pacified and quiet. At the end
		of two years this was verified, for the magistrates commented on the
		fact at that time that there were fewer crimes of violence before
		them than had been customary.</p>

		<p>I have learned to rely on this prescience, and in reference to public
		men and public affairs, when they interested me, have satisfied
		my curiosity by the psychometric method.</p>

		<p>For twelve months past the newspaper press and the statesmen of
		Europe and America have been continually agitated by apprehensions
		of a great European war, and have made numerous estimates
		of the power of belligerents and the result of the contest. France
		and Germany have been expected to engage in a fatal conflict, and
		even a noted public medium has fallen in with these ideas and predicted
		a coming war this year.</p>

		<p>I have kept the record of public opinion, and from time to time
		have invoked the aid of psychometry, which has dissipated every fear
		and contradicted all the pessimistic notions of politicians and newspaper
		correspondents down to the present time.</p>

		<p>On the 26th of January I recorded the psychometric impressions,
		again in February, and again on the 11th of March. The psychometer
		answers questions or discusses subjects by impression alone, not
		knowing what is under her hand, but expressing what arises in her
		mind. The first impression, January 26, was as follows:</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page5" title="5"> </a>“It looks misty, but the finale looks bright. The result of this,
		whatever it is, will be a grand success or achievement—good will
		result. There is a dissatisfaction or rivalry on a very large scale—very
		momentous—is it war? There is agitation and blustering.”</p>

		<p><em>Q.</em>—How will it be in the summer?</p>

		<p>“There will not be war. There is a growing contention, like
		growling, angry dogs; they may keep up growling for a year, but it
		will be nothing; there will be good coming out of it—a better
		understanding; this experience will elevate the views of the people;
		they will see the folly, and not be so belligerent. <em>There will be no war</em>
		this summer.”</p>

		<p>What was the drift of opinion, however, as shown by the press?
		The correspondent of the New York <cite>Sun</cite> said: “Everybody talks
		of war as a sure thing which must soon appear somewhere. The
		work of getting ready for the fray, of which I have often sent
		details, goes steadily on.” M. Thibaudin “hopes for peace, as do all
		other diplomats trained and admired for their ability to say what they
		don’t think; and finally he announces that France is ready to fight
		whenever the time comes.” January 29 he writes: “The <cite>Daily
		News</cite> war scare which shook us up early in the week seems not to
		have exhausted its disquieting influence yet.” “France and Germany
		are looked upon as certain to lead off the ball, and Germany,
		it is generally thought, will be found at the head of the set and take
		the initiative. Preparations for a big fight continue in every direction.”
		“Russia, if we can believe the tales from that unreliable country,
		is quietly making preparations on a tremendous scale to have
		her paw fall heavily on somebody.”</p>

		<p>The French <cite>Revue des Deux Mondes</cite> said about this time that a
		war between France and Germany would almost inevitably lead to
		a general European war, on a scale such as the world has never
		before seen.</p>

		<p>The Russian <cite>Viedomosti</cite> of February 5 said: “No compromise is
		possible between Russia and Austria concerning Eastern affairs, without
		detriment to Russia and the Eastern races. German intervention
		is useless, and will only create hostility between Russia and Germany.”</p>

		<p>The Boston <cite>Herald</cite> correspondent of February 5, said of France
		and Germany: “Now both are counted as among the most civilized
		and most humanitarian on the face of the globe, and yet the <em>certainty
		of war</em> between the two hereditary enemies on either side of the
		Rhine is <em>as certain as anything can be</em>. When it comes, be it sooner
		or later, one of the two adversaries is inevitably condemned, if not to
		total annihilation, at least to such a crushing punishment that for
		many long years the defeated power will be little more than a geographical
		expression on modern maps.” His letter concluded with
		an elaborate statement of the military resources and condition of the
		two nations, which approximate an equality in the aggregate.</p>

		<p>A Paris dispatch of the same date said that “Prince Bismarck has
		succeeded in establishing a coalition between Austria, England, and
		Italy against Russia. Germany will join the coalition if France
		supports Russia.”</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page6" title="6"> </a>The New York <cite>Sun</cite> of February 7, said: “We suppose there is no
		subject which just now is more earnestly discussed among intelligent
		Americans than the probable result of the war between France and
		Germany which is believed to be approaching. France ought by
		this time to have outstripped her enemy in point of military efficiency.
		She has laid out since 1871 nearly twice as much on her
		permanent armament, and she devotes nearly twice as much to the
		current military expenses of each year. She has maintained a larger
		peace establishment, and she should have it in her power to bring to
		the field a larger number of soldiers who have served under the colors.”</p>

		<p>February 10 the Paris correspondent of the Berlin <cite>Post</cite> said that
		General Boulanger was growing in popularity, and “is regarded by
		the masses as the long-expected liberator. The whole country is
		anxious for <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revanche</em> [revenge], and is arming silently, but with the
		evident belief that the hour is coming.” To add to the growing hostility,
		the <cite>Post</cite> quotes from the Paris <cite>Figaro</cite> an article imputing the
		grossest immorality to German women.</p>

		<p>At the same date, the Buda Pesth <cite>Journal</cite> urged Austria to attack
		Russia before the latter has completed her preparations on the lower
		Danube. It said: “<em>War is inevitable</em>, and it is better to begin fighting
		before the Balkan states have been Russianized.”</p>

		<p>Senor Castillo, the Spanish minister of the interior, said that Spain
		had taken steps to augment her defences and protect her colonies,
		in view of the possible European war.</p>

		<p>February 12 a despatch to the London <cite>News</cite> from St. Petersburg said:
		“Ominous fears of a European war prevail here. It is announced
		that German colonists in the Caucasus have been notified to hold
		themselves in readiness to return to Germany and join the reserves.”</p>

		<p>At the same date the <cite>North German Gazette</cite> said that since
		General Boulanger had assumed charge of the French war office not
		a day had passed without measures being taken to augment the
		offensive strength of the army, and there were constant movements
		of troops upon the frontiers.</p>

		<p>February 19 the news was still more alarming at Berlin. Work
		was going on night and day on the fortifications at Verdun and
		Belfort. “All commerce has been suspended at Metz, excepting in
		food. The inhabitants are storing their houses from cellar to garret.”
		A Russian paper of that date said, “Existing circumstances admit of
		no delay.”</p>

		<p>At Vienna, February 18, it was announced that “a semi-official
		letter from St. Petersburg represents that Russia is waiting for a
		Franco-German conflict, <em>which she considers inevitable</em>, to realize her
		own Balkan projects. Russia would consider it to be to her own
		interest not to allow Germany to be victorious.”</p>

		<p>February 19 Senator Beck at Washington referred to an extract
		from a late speech of Count von Moltke before the German Reichstag,
		to show that <em>war is inevitable</em>.</p>

		<p>February 27 the London despatch to the <cite>Boston Herald</cite> said:
		“Within the last forty-eight hours confidence in the maintenance of
		peace has visibly lessened.”</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page7" title="7"> </a>About the same time in Russian government circles the conviction
		was said to be gaining ground that a Franco-German war was inevitable,
		and that it would be for the interest of Russia to save France
		from disaster.</p>

		<p>March 6 the <cite>North German Gazette</cite> said that the Alsace elections
		had strengthened the war party in France. War seems to have
		been the general anticipation of military men. General Wolseley
		(February 26) is reported to have said: “I feel sure that a vast,
		appalling war is certainly in the near future; but this, indeed,
		everybody may be said to know.”</p>

		<p>But “everybody” is as liable to be mistaken on questions of
		futurity as on questions of philosophy and religion, on which the
		multitude called “everybody” has been largely mistaken ever since
		the earliest periods known to history. “Everybody” is generally
		pessimistic, apt to be superstitious, and never philosophic. A single
		good psychometric perception is worth much more than Mr. Everybody’s
		opinion, whether upon national policy, personal character, historical
		truth, or medical science.</p>

		<p>The psychometric opinion is the opposite of that of General
		Wolseley and Senator Beck, for the psychometric soul is in the
		calm sphere of truth, in which the passions have no deceiving power.
		I have already published in the “Manual of Psychometry” the prediction
		of universal peace at the end of five years from the prophecy,
		and I now repeat the statement that great Franco-German war
		is but the fantasy of passion and fear. The last psychometric
		expression, March 11, confirms the uniform statements heretofore.
		Upon the question “What of the war in Europe?” this was the
		impression:</p>

		<p>“This seems a question of occurrences. I seem to disagree with
		other people on this question. It does not seem to me that it will
		occur. If there are any prognostications, they are <em>intensified</em>. The
		result will not be what is predicted. There is something like a foreshadowing
		that might cause a prediction, but it will pass over.
		There is a good deal of agitation and concern, but nothing will occur
		this year as apprehended. I feel that it will all subside, and a picture
		of brightness and a clear sky appears. The fire will burn out;
		the boiling caldron which sends up steam will be quiet; <em>a peaceful
		time is coming</em>.”</p>

		<p>When the <cite class="name">Journal</cite> shall have a little more space, for <em>it must be
		enlarged</em>, and psychometry is a little better understood, I propose to
		establish a prophetic department, and speak to my readers of coming
		events.</p>

		<h2 class="title">A Modern Miracle Worker.</h2>

		<p class="subtitle">AN INTERVIEW WITH MR. GEORGE MILNER STEPHEN.</p>

		<p><span class="first_word">Every</span> one knows Sir James Fitzjames Stephen; most people
		have heard of Mr. Leslie Stephen—the two most distinguished
		members of the Stephen family resident in this country. The
		<a class="pagenum" id="page8" title="8"> </a>Stephen clan, however, is widespread, and there are eminent Stephens
		scattered all over the world. “Any Stephen,” said Mr. Froude in
		his “Oceanea,” “could not fail to be interesting.” Sir Alfred Stephen,
		the deputy governor of New South Wales, is declared by Mr.
		Froude to be regarded as the greatest Australian, by nine out of
		every ten of the people of Sydney. But the judicial renown of Fitzjames,
		the literary fame of Leslie, and the colonial reputation of Sir
		Alfred, all pale their ineffectual fires before the marvellous claims of
		George Milner Stephen, across whom Mr. Froude stumbled in New
		Zealand, and who has now turned up unexpectedly in London. He
		is, as Mr. Froude said, a very noticeable person. In fact, he is a
		thaumaturgist of the first order. While his relatives in the old
		country have devoted all the energy of their intellect to demonstrate
		the absurdity of all the superstitions built upon any arbitrary interference
		with the invariable laws of nature, their kinsman George
		Milner suddenly displays at the antipodes a gift of healing which,
		if the veracious records of colonial and American newspapers can be
		relied upon, rivals the most famous exploits of apostolic times.
		Not, indeed, that George Milner has yet raised the dead to life.
		That is beyond his powers. But all the minor marvels, such as
		making the blind to see, the deaf to hear, the dumb to speak, and
		the lame to walk, are accomplished by him in the ordinary course of
		his daily practice. Although this miracle-working Stephen is a
		physician whose patients are healed by the touch, he is nevertheless
		a physician practising the healing art like other eminent authorities—for
		the prescribed fee of the ordinary medical practitioners. The
		only difference is that whereas the ordinary physician attends his
		patient daily for weeks and sometimes months, Mr. Stephen’s course,
		if a course at all, ends at the latest in three visits, and the charges,
		therefore, are correspondingly low. Two guineas for consultation
		fee, one guinea each subsequent visit, or four guineas at the outside,
		are to be regarded as his retaining fee; but in those cases—and
		they are said to constitute a large proportion of those submitted to
		him—in which he effects a complete cure he naturally expects to be
		remembered by the grateful patient whom he has restored to health.
		This, however, by the way. In response to an invitation to the <cite>Pall
		Mall Gazette</cite> office, Mr. George Milner Stephen described to a member
		of our staff with much detail the nature of his work. It is a
		sufficiently marvelous story to arouse attention, even on the part of
		the incredulous; and the unbelieving authorities owe it to the
		public to institute a series of investigations into their relative’s
		claims, in order that he may either be claimed as the master healer of
		his age, or summarily prosecuted as a rogue and vagabond, who is
		obtaining money under false pretences. It is monstrous that a gentleman
		of his rank and position should be allowed to go at large,
		making such enormous claims of quasi-supernatural powers, without
		having them promptly brought to the most rigorous of scientific
		tests.</p>

		<p>Mr. George Milner Stephen is a man of wide and varied culture,
		of great experience in affairs, and has spent his life in public service
		<a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9"> </a>of the most varied kind. Brought up to the bar, he has been a
		trained lawyer all his life. He has been acting-governor of South
		Australia; he refused the colonial secretaryship of New Zealand;
		he has been official draftsman for the colony of Victoria; he has held
		the balance of power in more than one colony; and in the colony of
		New South Wales, at the time when he suddenly discovered his
		miraculous powers, he was leading counsel on circuit, and in receipt
		of one of the largest professional incomes of any lawyer at the
		antipodes. Nor was his training solely colonial. He had repeatedly
		visited England, and had been called to our bar. He takes a
		keen interest in mineralogical science, and in the course of his career
		has exhibited on more than one occasion great personal bravery and
		indomitable nerve. That such a man, so highly connected, so carefully
		trained, with the intellect of a lawyer and the experience of a
		statesman, should be in our midst claiming to be endowed with the
		gift of healing spoken of in the New Testament as vouchsafed to the
		Christians of apostolic times, is a portent indeed, and one well
		worthy of the attentive consideration of the most sceptical among us.</p>

		<p>“It was six and a half years ago,” said Mr. Stephen in reply to a
		question, “that I first discovered that I possessed this gift of healing—it
		was by pure accident. A friend who suffered from deafness
		jokingly appealed to me to give him back his hearing. I, also in
		joke, made some passes over his head, when to my utter astonishment
		I discovered that his deafness disappeared. One experiment
		of this kind led to another, and in a short time I found myself overwhelmed
		with patients of high and low degree, begging me to heal
		them of their diseases. For three months after the discovery of my
		gift the sudden influx of patients who would not be denied left me
		no time to attend to my practice; and, willy nilly, I was compelled
		to give up the law and take to medicine—if you may call by the
		name of medicine a profession in which no medicine is given.”</p>

		<p>“Then do you use no medicine at all?”</p>

		<p>“None whatever. The nearest approach to medicine that I ever
		gave to a patient is a little magnetized ointment—that is, camphorated
		lard, and a little magnetized oil. But it is only occasionally
		that I use these. Neither do I use passes, although it was by the
		use of passes that I first discovered that I possessed this gift.”</p>

		<p>“But how do you proceed?”</p>

		<p>“Variously. Sometimes I lay my hand upon the part affected;
		at other times I breathe into the eye, ear, or mouth of the patient.
		Then, again, on other occasions I am able to banish the disease by a
		mere word or gesture.”</p>

		<p>“Are you a mesmerist or a magnetic healer?”</p>

		<p>“Mesmerist I am not; for mesmerism implies the throwing of
		the patient into a mesmeric sleep. Neither am I a magnetist, properly
		so called, for there is no outgoing of magnetism from my body
		when I am healing. The ordinary magnetist admits that he cannot
		cure more than four persons per diem; I have cured as many as
		thirty, and beyond the weariness caused by standing, I have been no
		worse at the end than at beginning.”</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10"> </a>“How do you explain these miracles?”</p>

		<p>“I don’t call them miracles. They are marvels, and I cannot explain
		them. All that I know is that I have gone through the Australian
		colonies, New Zealand, and many of the States in America,
		and that wherever I have gone the same effect followed. At my
		touch, diseases and defects declared incurable by the first physicians
		of the faculty, disappear. I remember well healing Sir James Martin,
		the chief justice of New South Wales. Six years ago he was
		given up by the doctors and declared to be dying, breathing with
		great difficulty, and hardly able to speak without pain. I laid my
		hand upon his chest, and in a few minutes all difficulty of breathing
		disappeared, he was able to speak freely, and in a short time he had
		completely recovered. He resumed his seat upon the bench, and
		remained a hale, active man till his death, which occurred just the
		other day. That is only one case out of many.”</p>

		<p>“How many?”</p>

		<p>“I think I have been the means of healing about 30,000 patients
		in the six and a half years during which I have devoted my time to
		the work. Of course many of those patients were suffering from
		diseases which might have been cured by ordinary means. Others
		were declared to be incurable.”</p>

		<p>“Declared to be incurable by whom?”</p>

		<p>“By the chief physicians in the colonies. I have in my pocket”—producing
		the papers as he spoke—“certificates signed by the
		witnesses, attested sometimes by magistrates, and at other times by
		ministers of religion and colonial ministers, that the person named
		in the certificate has received instantaneous relief by my touch.
		Here is one in which a person stone-blind from birth received sight
		when I blew into his eyes.”</p>

		<p>“Then do you cure all diseases?”</p>

		<p>“Certainly not. There are many things which I cannot do. I
		cannot raise the dead, nor can I restore an arm which has been cut
		off, a joint which has been excised, or an eye which has been destroyed.
		When there has been complete destruction of any important organ I
		cannot effect a cure; but when destruction of the organ has not
		been complete, I am frequently able to effect a cure in cases which
		the regular faculty have given up as utterly hopeless.”</p>

		<p>“Take cancer, for instance: can you cure that?”</p>

		<p>“I have treated some cases with remarkable success; but of
		course I can do so only when the cancer has not eaten too far into
		the vital organism of the sufferer. I have treated some thirty cancer
		cases, the cure in all being complete. The treatment was that
		of laying my hands over the part affected, anointing with a little
		magnetized ointment, and sometimes the injection of magnetized oil.
		Beyond that I do nothing. I have here records of ten cures of cancer
		in all parts of the body. If you will glance over the accounts,
		described by the newspapers at the time when they occurred, or
		copies of the certificates which I leave with you, you will see that
		there is almost no limit to the variety of the cures which I have
		been able to effect.”</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11"> </a>“That is all very well, Mr. Stephen, but you will not make converts
		by newspaper extracts. The point is this: Will you consent
		to submit your gift to a practical test?”</p>

		<p>“Certainly,” said he; “I have already written to Sir Baldwin
		Leighton, asking him if he can place me in communication with the
		governors of deaf, dumb, and blind asylums, in order that I may be
		able to try my powers upon the patients of those institutions. I am
		quite satisfied that if I am allowed a fair opportunity of trying the
		effect of my healing touch, ten out of every hundred of the inmates
		of these asylums will receive their sight, or regain their speech and
		hearing. I ask for no payment: I simply request that in these institutions
		which are maintained by the public charity for the relief of
		helpless sufferers, and where, therefore, there can be no collusion or
		any suspicion of trickery or fraud, I should be allowed to lay my
		hands upon the eyes or the ears of the inmates. I can do them no
		harm; and I am perfectly sure that in at least ten per cent of the
		cases I shall be able to give great if not entire relief.”</p>

		<p>“This is all very well; but before you can expect the governors
		of public institutions to allow you to touch their inmates there must
		be a preliminary illustration of your power. Otherwise they would
		say justly that they would be over-run with quacks, all of whom
		might wish to try a patent nostrum upon the unfortunate ‘inmates
		of public institutions.’”</p>

		<p>“Very well,” said Mr. Stephen, “I am willing to submit my gift
		to the most stringent test which your scientific sceptics can suggest.
		I am willing to give an exhibition of my power under any test, in
		the presence of any picked number of sceptics whom you may nominate,
		and you may bring there half a dozen cases of disease certified
		by the faculty as incurable. Of course you will not bring sufferers
		whose complaints are manifestly beyond my power to cure. As I
		said before, I make no claim to restore organs that are destroyed,
		but there is a sufficiently wide category in the complaints ‘that flesh
		is heir to’ to afford you an ample choice of half a dozen typical incurable
		cases. When the deaf, dumb, lame, and otherwise suffering
		persons whom you wish experimented on have been brought and are
		in the presence of those whom you shall name, I will undertake to
		effect an immediate improvement in the condition of, say, four
		out of the six. It will probably become a complete cure on the
		second or third visit. I seldom or never see a patient more than
		thrice.”</p>

		<p>“Well, that seems fair. You have no objection to my publishing
		this offer in the <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite>?”</p>

		<p>“None. I make no profession to any skill. I can only exercise
		a power which I discovered quite accidentally was vested in
		me. The limits of that I can ascertain only by experience. I
		am perfectly willing to have that power subjected to the severest
		tests which you can suggest, and I have no doubt at all, from the
		invariable experience of the last six years, that cures will be
		effected for which no existing scientific hypothesis can adequately
		account.”</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12"> </a>The <cite>Gazette</cite> says in another column:—“We commend the challenge
		of Mr. George Milner Stephen, which we publish in another
		column, to the special attention of all interested in the exposure of
		popular delusion. Here is an educated English barrister of unimpeachable
		character, who has rendered no little service to the state,
		informing all the faculty that he can heal patients whom they have
		dismissed as incurable, by merely breathing on them or touching
		them. In an ordinary, unknown, vulgar charlatan this challenge
		might have passed unnoticed. In the case of the Australian cousin
		of Mr. Justice Fitzjames Stephen it must be treated more seriously.
		We invite communications from our scientific readers as to the best
		way of putting our visitor to the test.”</p>

		<p>Scores of American healers do similar works to those of Dr. G. M.
		Stephen, but the fashionable press ignores them because they have
		not wealth and social position. The <cite class="name">Journal of Man</cite> will endeavor
		to do them justice. In all such cases, in which the healing
		power is inexhaustible, we know that it is replenished from spiritual
		sources. Dr. Stephen exercises a little policy in not mentioning the
		spiritual source of his power. Godless science and dead sectarianism
		recoil from spirit life. No human constitution contains an inexhaustible
		fountain of life—the fountain is above, and fortunate are
		they who can reach it.</p>

		<h2 class="title">Human Longevity.</h2>

		<p><span class="first_word">The</span> possibility of long life, illustrated in the first number of this
		<cite class="name">Journal</cite>, may easily be corroborated by referring to numerous
		examples; but the fact that the nobler qualities of human nature are
		the most efficient promoters of longevity is our most important
		lesson, and it is illustrated by the superior longevity of women. He
		is a misanthrope who does not recognize their superior virtue, and
		he is a poor statesman who does not wish to see that virtue imparted
		to our political life, and who does not recognize the importance of
		giving to woman the most perfect intellectual and industrial
		education, that she may be self supporting. The British census
		show that there are 948,000 more women than men in Great Britain.
		The <cite>St. James Gazette</cite> says:—</p>

		<p>“Prof. Humphry of Cambridge has prepared a series of tables
		which contain some interesting information about centenarians. Of
		52 persons whom he mentions, at least 11—2 males and 9 females—actually
		attained the age of 100. Others attained very nearly to
		the hundred years. Only one of the persons reached 108 years,
		while one died at the alleged age of 106. Of the 52 persons, 36
		were women and 16 men. Out of the 36 women 26 had been
		married, and 11 had borne large families. Of the 26 who had
		been wives, 8 had married before they were 20, 1 at 16, and 2
		at 17.</p>

		<p>“Twelve of the fifty-two centenarians were discovered to have
		been the eldest children of their parents. This fact, adds Dr.
		<a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13"> </a>Humphry, does not agree with popular notions that first children
		inherit a feebleness of constitution, nor with the opinion of racing
		stables, which is decidedly against the idea that ‘firstlings’ are to
		be depended on for good performances on the course. The centenarians
		generally regarded were of spare build. Gout and rheumatism
		were as a rule, absent. ‘It seems,’ says Prof. Humphry, ‘that
		the frame which is destined to great age needs no such prophylactics,
		and engenders none of the peccant humors for which the finger
		joints (as in gout) may find a vent.’</p>

		<p>“Of the fifty-two aged people, twenty-four only had no teeth, the
		average number of teeth remaining being four or five. Long hours
		of sleep were notable among these old people, the period of repose
		averaging nine hours; while out-of-door exercise in plenty and
		early rising are to be noted among the factors of a prolonged life.
		One of the centenarians ‘drank to excess on festive occasions:’
		another was a ‘free beer drinker,’ and ‘drank like a fish during
		his whole life.’ Twelve had been total abstainers for life or nearly
		so, and mostly all were ‘small meat eaters.’”</p>

		<p>The oldest woman in Austria at this time is Magdalene Ponza,
		who is 112. “She was born at Wittingau, Bohemia, in 1775, when
		Maria Theresa sat on the Austrian throne. George III. had then
		been but 15 years King of England, Louis XVI. who had ruled a
		little more than a twelvemonth in France, was still in the heyday of
		power, the Independence of the United States of America had not
		yet been declared, Napoleon and Arthur Wellesley were as yet but
		six years old. Magdalene Ponza retains full possession of her mental
		faculties. Unfortunately she can only speak the Czech language, and
		she can neither read nor write. However, she answers questions briskly
		enough through the youngest of her surviving grandchildren, herself
		a woman of 60. Magdalene Ponza’s age is authenticated by the
		outdoor relief certificate of the Viennese Municipality.”</p>

		<p>Of American centenarians we have a number, some of whom are
		still living. Harrisonville, New Jersey, has two, Michael Potter and
		Bartholomew Coles. Polly Wilcox of Hope Valley, R.&nbsp;I., celebrated
		her centennial last year; so did Jane Wilcox of Edgecomb, Maine,
		while she had a sister 94, and a daughter 81. Old Auntie Scroggins,
		of Forsyth Co., Georgia, is now 104 years old, and is still one of the
		most effective shouters of the Methodist Church to which she has
		belonged 94 years.</p>

		<p>Miss Phebe Harrod, of Newburyport, Mass., celebrated her
		centennial last year. She still takes a lively interest in passing events.</p>

		<p>Grandmother Sarah Drew, at Halifax, celebrated her centennial a
		year ago. Her constant companion is an old Bible which has been
		in the Drew family for 250 years.</p>

		<p>Mrs. Triphene Bevans, of Danbury, Mass., held a lively centennial
		reception in the parlors of the West Street Church, April 14, 1886.
		Her health, hearing and speech were good, and her step brisk. She
		attributes her age and good health to good habits and allowing
		nothing to trouble or worry her. She has always been a strict
		church member.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14"> </a>William Waterman, of Oshkosh, Wisconsin, is said to be 109
		years old. It is said he “is a Methodist, uses liquor and tobacco,
		and finds no fault with the world.”</p>

		<p>Joseph O’Neal of Barnesville, Georgia, might have been living
		still if he had not been frozen to death last winter, at the age of 107,
		in a sudden blizzard. He was a negro, and had over 200 descendants.</p>

		<p>Mrs. Elizabeth Thomas, of Reading, Penn., who had lived a century,
		might be still living if she had not been killed last year, while
		walking on the railroad track.</p>

		<p>Of those who overrun the century, we might mention further,
		Simon Harras, who died in Putnam Co., Indiana, last January,
		aged 109. His memory was good to the last.</p>

		<p>Mrs. Elizabeth Small, relict of Dr. Samuel Small, at
		Lewiston, Maine, had passed her hundredth birthday a few
		weeks, when she died of apoplexy; and Mrs. Susan Phillips,
		of Wilson Creek, N.&nbsp;C., died last year just as she finished her
		century.</p>

		<p>Nathan, formerly slave of Benj. W. Bodie, died last year in
		Mississippi, Talbot Co., aged 107.</p>

		<p>Christopher Mann, of Independence, Missouri, died last year, aged
		111.</p>

		<p>The oldest of all, and probably the oldest minister in the
		world, is Rev. Thos. Tenant, of Vineyard Township, Arkansas,
		an itinerant Methodist preacher, born in 1771, now in his 116th
		year.</p>

		<p>Mr. Edward Gentry told a more remarkable story at Indianapolis,
		last July. He was at the governor’s office, and gentlemen were
		guessing at his age. None supposed him over fifty; but he said he
		had a son fifty-two years old, and was himself seventy-eight. He
		added: “My doctor has given me a fifty years’ longer lease on my life,
		barring accidents. My father is 128 and is still living. My mother
		died at the age of 117, and her mother lived to the same age.” Mr.
		Gentry is of English birth.</p>

		<p>Perhaps the best specimen of family health is that of the Atkinson
		family of Gloucester, Mass. Nine children were born, and all lived.
		The first death in the family was a few weeks ago, when John
		Atkinson died, aged eighty-four. When he died the ages of the nine
		amounted to 703 years.</p>

		<p>Aunt Dinah John, the oldest Indian at the Onondaga reservation
		died in May, 1884, aged 109.</p>

		<p>About ten years ago, when Governor Seymour was about to make
		an address at an Indian fair on the Onondaga reservation, Aunt
		Dinah walked upon the platform and asked to be introduced to him.</p>

		<p>Mr. Gardner said, “Governor Seymour, this is Aunt Dinah, who
		wants to become acquainted with you.”</p>

		<p>“Oh, no; him get acquainted with me,” Aunt Dinah explained.
		“Me know him before he know anybody. Many years ago me go
		to Pompey Hill, his father’s grocery. Governor’s father say: ‘My
		squaw very sick.’ I ask, ‘What matter?’ His father say, ‘Go in
		<a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15"> </a>and see for yourself.’ He go into a room; see a little pappoose
		about a foot long.” Then moving toward Governor Seymour, and
		pointing her finger at him, she said: “That pappoose was you,
		Governor Seymour, born that night.”</p>

		<p>Aunt Dinah called frequently at Mr. Seymour’s and took especial
		delight in rocking the cradle and showering caresses in her native
		fashion upon the future Governor of the State.</p>

		<p>About three years ago she became blind, and has since been kept
		at her home on the Onondaga reservation. She retained her faculties
		to the last. Her husband died thirty years ago. Her dying
		request was that the pagan ceremony be first observed and afterward
		the Christian ritual.</p>

		<p>What are we to reckon, says the <cite>Home Journal</cite>, as the declining
		period of man’s existence? The point at which old age taps us on
		the shoulder, and says it comes to keep us company, varies with
		every individual. It depends a great deal on circumstances, which
		are hardly the same in any two cases. Some writers have said that
		a man is old at forty-five, others have set down seventy as the
		normal standard. Dr. John Gardner, who has written on “Longevity,”
		remarks: “Long observation has convinced me that sixty-three
		is an age at which the majority of persons may be termed old,
		and as a general rule we may adopt this as the epoch of the commencing
		decline of life.”</p>

		<p>Suppose then we agree to call no man old till he is past sixty-three.
		Let us set down the names of some of the illustrious people
		of the world who have prolonged their days of usefulness after that
		age. We shall make a table of them, and begin it with those who
		have died at seventy,—that is to say, with those in whom the
		springs of life have not stood still till they have had at least seven
		years of old age. It will be found, however, to be far from exhaustive,
		and every reader may find pleasure in adding to it from
		his own stock of information:</p>

		<p>It may be said that they were exceptional in living so long, but if
		what the best authorities say be true, the exceptions ought to be the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page16" title="16"> </a>people who died young, and not those who prolong their lives and
		carry on their work till they are old. Few of us may find ourselves,
		like Lord Palmerston, in our greatest vigor at seventy, or be able,
		like Thiers, to rule France at eighty, or have any spirit for playing
		the author, like Goethe and Victor Hugo, when over eighty; or for
		playing the musician, like Handel and Haydn, when over seventy;
		but by good management we may do wonders.</p>

		<p>The wisest men and the best have been conspicuous for working
		to the end, not taking the least advantage of the leisure to which
		one might think they were entitled. They have found their joy in
		pursuing labors which they believed useful either to themselves or
		to others. John Locke began a “Fourth Letter on Toleration”
		only a few weeks before he died, and “the few pages in the posthumous
		volume, ending in an unfinished sentence, seem to have exhausted
		his remaining strength.” The fire of Galileo’s genius burned
		to the very end. He was engaged in dictating to two of his disciples
		his latest theories on a favorite subject, when the slow fever seized
		him that brought him to the grave. Sir Edward Coke spent the
		last six years of his life in revising and improving the works upon
		which his fame now rests. John Wesley only the year before he died
		wrote: “I am now an old man, decayed from head to foot….
		However, blessed be God! I do not slack my labors; I can preach
		and write still.” Arnauld, one of the greatest of French theologians
		and philosophers, retained, says Disraeli, “the vigor of his genius
		and the command of his pen to his last day, and at the age of eighty-two
		was still the great Arnauld.” It was he who, when urged in
		his old age to rest from his labors, exclaimed, “Rest! Shall we
		not have the whole of eternity to rest in?”</p>

		<p>A healthy old age cannot be reached without the exercise of many
		virtues. There must have been prudence, self-denial, and temperance
		at the very least. According to the proverb, he that would be
		long an old man must begin early to be one, and the beginning early
		just means taking a great many precautions commonly neglected till
		it is too late. More people would be found completing their pilgrimage
		at a late date if it were not that, as a French writer puts it,
		“Men do not usually die; they kill themselves.” It is carelessness
		about the most ordinary rules of healthy living.</p>

		<p>The enjoyment of old age may be looked on then as a reward, and
		the aged may pride themselves on being heirs to a rich inheritance,
		assigned to forethought and common sense. Many years are an
		honor. They are an honor even in the case of the worldly, and a
		great deal more so when life has been regulated by motives higher
		than any the world can show. “The hoary head,” says Solomon,
		“is a crown of glory;” but he adds this qualification, “if it be found
		in the way of righteousness.” Old people form a natural aristocracy,
		and to be ranked among them may be recommended to all who have
		an ambition to close their lives well up in the world.</p>

		<p>For a picture of an old man in this enviable state of mind take
		Cornaro. In his eighty-third year we find him congratulating himself
		that in all probability he “had still a series of years to live in
		<a class="pagenum" id="page17" title="17"> </a>health and spirits and to enjoy this beautiful world, which is indeed
		beautiful to those who know how to make it so.” Even at ninety-five
		he wrote of himself as “sound and hearty, contented and cheerful.”
		“At this age,” he says, “I enjoy at once two lives: one terrestrial,
		which I possess in fact; the other celestial, which I possess
		in thought; and this thought is equal to actual enjoyment, when
		founded on things we are sure to attain, as I am sure to attain that
		celestial life, through the infinite mercy and goodness of God.”</p>

		<p>Jeremy Bentham, who lived to be eighty-five, retained to the last
		the fresh and cheerful temperament of a boy. John Wesley, who died
		when he was eighty-eight, also had a happy disposition. “I feel and
		grieve,” he says, “but by the grace of God I fret at nothing.”
		Goethe, who reached his eighty-third year, is another good example.
		Then there is Boerhaave, one of the most celebrated physicians of
		modern times, who held that decent mirth is the salt of life. Indeed
		in the case of most old people, we believe it will be found that cheerfulness
		is one of their leading characteristics.</p>

		<p>The recent death of Mr. Beecher, who with his splendid constitution
		ought to have lived twenty years longer, illustrates the principles
		of hygiene which he blindly disregarded. For years he was
		threatened with the form of death that seized him, and came near a
		fatal attack some years ago in Chicago while delivering a lecture.
		Men of a strong animal nature, hearty eaters, and restless workers,
		making great use of the brain, are liable to such attacks. If Mr.
		Beecher had observed ordinary prudence, and had a little scientific magnetic
		treatment, he would never have had an apoplectic attack;
		but he was commonplace in thought. He went the old way, and died
		as short-sighted men die. He had read my “Anthropology,” and told
		me he kept it in his library, but its thought did not enter into his life.</p>

		<h2 class="title">Justice to the Indians.</h2>

		<p class="author">BY JOHN BEESON.</p>

		<p><span class="first_word">President Grant</span> placed them under control of the churches,
		making them responsible for all their Indian agents, whom the
		churches were to nominate. But as fraud and war have been more
		or less as rampant as ever, it seems that the first thing should be, to
		relieve the Indians from church rule, and recognize at once the
		Indian’s inalienable right to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,”
		the same as we claim for ourselves; so long as they do not
		disturb the peace or violate the rights of their white neighbors, we
		have no right to interfere with either their religion or laws upon
		their reserves. It is this meddlesome injustice which makes all
		the trouble; it would make trouble with any other community, if
		another religious sect should be allowed to dominate over them in
		<a class="pagenum" id="page18" title="18"> </a>all their affairs. It is not Indian, but human, nature, to do so, the
		world over. Dr. Bland, editor of <cite>The Council Fire</cite>, says:</p>

		<blockquote>
		  <p>“I have been long and intimately acquainted with many tribes. I find that they
		  are not savages, but the peers of white men, with great self-respect, a high sense of
		  honor, and love of truth.”</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Even the civilized tribes still retain their mutual confidence.
		Hence, they use no locks, no bolts nor bars, when absent from their
		homes; a stake in the ground, about three feet from the door, is a
		sufficient guarantee from intrusion. It would be deemed a reflection
		upon neighborly honor to lock a door in the Indian Territory. I
		was there when they built their first prison; they now number sixty
		thousand, most of whom have lived there forty years, and then,
		they said,</p>

		<blockquote>
		  <p>“The new railroad brought so many white renegades among us that we had to
		  build a prison for them.”</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>I asked, “What do you do when one Indian kills another?” They
		answered: “We have a trial, and if the killing was without great
		cause, we sentence the guilty one to be killed by the near of kin to
		his victim; we appoint the time and the place, and we have never
		known an Indian to fail to come voluntarily in time for his own
		execution.”</p>

		<p>They believe that the Great Spirit will give all the hell or all
		the heaven that each deserves; that there is no possibility of escape
		from a just penalty and no danger of losing a deserved heaven, but
		to them it is unjust to hope for anything on the merits of another.
		H. W. Beecher said in his first lecture after his return from the
		Pacific Coast:</p>

		<blockquote>
		  <p>“I made special inquiry of those who are posted on Indian affairs, as to their
		  moral status, and was always told that when fairly treated they are quite reliable.”</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Gen. Crookes said of the Apaches, that while they were protected
		on their reserves from outside aggression they were as well behaved
		and orderly as any community of people in the United States.</p>

		<p>It is true, they killed Generals Canby and Custer, but the first
		had, contrary to preliminary agreement, moved his soldiers twenty-five
		miles, and placed them in two companies on each side of the
		place where the treaty was to be made. The first demand of the
		Modoc chief was, to take back the soldiers, and it was not until a
		long delay, and a firm refusal on the part of Canby, that the Modoc
		chief fired the fatal shot.</p>

		<p>And as for Custer and his men, they fell while ignobly, and without
		right or authority, invading the peaceful home of Sitting Bull
		and his people.</p>

		<p>General Harney says:</p>

		<blockquote>
		  <p>“I have lived fifty years on the frontier, and I have never known an Indian war
		  in which they were not in the right.”</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Dr. McLaughlin said:</p>

		<blockquote>
		  <p>“I have been fifty-three years an Indian trader, and more than fifty years superintendent
		  of the Hudson Bay Fur Company, and in all that time, I have never seen
		  an occasion to shed the blood of an Indian. The American people suppose that
		  their revenge is proof of savagery. But that is a mistake. It is their sense of
		  justice, and whatever they do is but an echo of what has been done to them.
		  They believe as Moses taught, blood for blood, life for life.”</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page19" title="19"> </a>Gen. Fremont said:</p>

		<blockquote>
		  <p>“I lived two years among the Indians with only one white woman, and was
		  never more kindly treated. I lost nothing, although all I had was accessible to
		  them.”</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Surely, testimony like this, in connection with their healing
		magnetism so freely given to Spiritualism, should awaken sympathy
		if not gratitude in their behalf.—<cite>New Thought</cite>.</p>

			<p><strong class="headline">Anatomy of the Brain.</strong>—Anatomy is considered the driest
			and most difficult of biological studies, but a careful attention to our
			description of the brain will show that it is very intelligible. After
			we get through with the anatomy, the description of organs and
			their functions is simple and practical. Every one should understand
			the outlines of cerebral anatomy, and then he can discuss the subject
			with imperfectly educated physicians, and show them their errors.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="miscellany_item" id="misc2">
			<p><strong class="headline">Mesmeric Cures</strong> of countless variety and marvelous success
			have occurred all through the present century. But when not
			effected by distinguished physicians, they have generally been ignored
			by the press, and their knowledge confined to a very narrow
			circle. Now, however, since eminent physicians at Paris are engaged,
			and the word <em>hypnotism</em> is substituted for mesmerism and magnetism,
			their performances are proclaimed by journalists and even by the
			medical press. The following is one of the latest reports. The
			reader will observe that when the medical faculty after a prolonged
			opposition yield to any new idea, they endeavor to ignore entirely
			the pioneers by whom the discoveries were made, and by whom an
			interest was created in the subject while the faculty were hostile.
			It will probably not be long before they adopt the leading ideas of
			homœopathy and endeavor to obliterate the memory of Hahnemann.</p>

			<p>“Hypnotism has been employed with considerable success in Paris
			for some time past in the treatment of hysterical diseases, by Charcot
			and others, but the case recently reported by M. Clovis Hugues,
			in France, is the most extraordinary application so far on record.
			A young lady of twenty was attacked six months ago with a nervous
			ailment which completely derived her of her voice. Electricity was
			tried, with a certain amount of success, but after a time it lost its
			effect and was abandoned in despair. As a last resort, her friends
			applied to Dr. Berillon, the hypnotic specialist. After consultation
			with Dr. Charcot, he undertook the cure. The girl was thrown
			into a mesmeric trance by the usual means, and Dr. Berillon suggested
			that she should say on waking, ‘I am twenty.’ On opening
			her eyes she uttered these words without the least effort. On the
			second day the suggestion was that she should converse with Dr.
			Berillon, and this she also did, but could talk with no one else.
			On the third day the doctor commanded her to talk with any one
			and at any time that she chose. She has been able to use her
			tongue freely ever since.”</p>

			and 1871 was celebrated tonight by the Cincinnati anarchists. It
			was the most revolutionary gathering ever seen in this city, and the
			speech of Mrs. Lucy E. Parsons, wife of the condemned anarchist,
			was of a very inflammatory character. The hall was crowded with
			men and women who drank beer at tables. It was a motley and
			dangerous looking throng. On the walls were mottoes with red
			borders, and the entire hall was profusely decorated with large red
			flags. There wasn’t an American flag in the hall, and above the
			stage was a picture of the condemned anarchists. Several pictures
			of notorious Anarchists who have been beheaded for murder and
			riot were conspicuously displayed. The band played no national
			airs except the ‘Marseillaise,’ and everything said and done showed
			a bitter hatred of American institutions. Mrs. Parsons gave a history
			of the Paris commune of 1871, and said the mistake made
			was in showing any mercy to capitalists. Her remarks were loudly

			of Hallam, Guizot, and Draper, as follows:</p>

			<p>“With respect to the last, the grandest of all human undertakings
			(i. e., the circumnavigation of the earth), it is to be remembered that
			Catholicism had irrevocably committed itself to the dogma of a flat
			earth, with the sky as a floor of heaven, and hell in the under
			world.”—<cite>Draper’s Conflict</cite>, p. 294.</p>

			<p>“Persecution for religious heterodoxy, in all its degrees, was in
			<a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21"> </a>the sixteenth century the principle as well as the practice of every
			church.”—<cite>Hallam’s Middle Ages</cite>, vol. 2, p. 48.</p>

			<p>“When any step was taken to establish a system of permanent
			institutions, which might effectually protect liberty from the invasions
			of power in general, <em>the church always ranged herself on the
			side of despotism</em>.”—<cite>Guizot’s History of Civilization in Europe</cite>,
			p. 154.</p>

			<p>“There was fighting and fighting between the old and new school,
			and all on a question that would make a crab laugh,—questions
			that were hypercritical and infinite, and about which everybody
			knew nothing at all, and they thought they knew as well as God.
			Questions were talked of with positiveness, and argued; and, when
			I look back upon them, I cannot help thinking they were no better
			than the contentions of children around the cradle. But all
			this gave me great repulsion for dogmatic theology, and it is a
			repulsion which I have not got over, and the present prospects are
			that I never shall.”—<cite>Henry Ward Beecher</cite>.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="miscellany_item" id="misc7">
			<p><strong class="headline">Earthquakes and predictions.</strong>—Professor Rudolf Falb, of
			Vienna, it is reported, predicted to an hour the earthquakes which
			have occurred in France and Italy.</p>

			<p>“Writing in the Austrian papers some days ago, he pointed out that
			the annular eclipse of the sun, which commenced on Tuesday morning
			at 6.41 Greenwich time, was central at 9.13 <span class="small_all_caps">P. M</span>., and ended on
			the earth generally at twenty-five minutes past midnight on Wednesday
			morning, was likely to be accompanied with strong atmospheric
			and seismic disturbances. The learned physicist has gained
			great reputation by previous similar forecasts. His first and great
			success was the foretelling the destructive shock at Belluno, on
			June 29, 1873. Nearly the whole of Northern Italy was affected,
			and upwards of fifty lives were lost. Very shortly afterwards he
			gave warning of the probability of an eruption of Etna, which
			followed at the time anticipated in 1874.”—<cite>London Echo</cite>.</p>

			<p>“John S. Newberry, professor of geology and paleontology at
			Columbia College, being the American authority upon all matters
			pertaining to the crust of the earth, was naturally interested in the
			earthquake that visited Long Island on Wednesday. He derides
			the idea that the local seismic disturbance has any connection with
			the recent occurrences at Mentone, as the shocks were too far apart,
			and, if connected, should have been felt within eight hours of each
			other, whereas there was several days’ difference. His theory, which
			is amply sustained by observation, is that an earthquake is a movement
			caused by a shrinking, from loss of heat, of the interior of the
			earth and the crushing together and displacement of the rigid exterior
			as it accommodates itself to this contraction. It has been
			noticed that the earth is shaken along the Alleghany chain nearly
			every year. It is impossible to predict a recurrence of the shocks,
			but it is quite probable they will recur. There is a record of 231
			earthquakes in the New England States between the years 1638 and
			1869.”—<cite>Brooklyn Eagle</cite>.</p>

		<p><span class="first_word">Man</span> is essentially a triple organization, consisting of the permanent
		psychic being, intangible to our external senses, but nevertheless
		so distinctly recognized internally by consciousness and externally
		or in others, by intuition and understanding, that the psychic is
		as well understood and known as the physical being. This being
		is the eternal man—the material body being its temporary associate.</p>

		<p>The physical being, or material form, consists of the portion
		directly and entirely occupied by the psychic existence—which is
		called the brain or encephalon, and is in life also beyond the reach
		of our senses in the interior of the cranium—and the non-psychic
		structure, the body, which, though not the residence of the soul, has
		so intimate and complete a connection with the entire brain that
		during active life it feels as if it were the actual residence of the
		soul, so far as sensation and action are concerned.</p>

		<p>The soul, or psychic being, has external and internal perceptions
		(for which it has cerebral organs). When the former predominate
		too greatly, the human body and all external objects are realized
		most vividly, and the reality of psychic life is not so well realized
		or understood. Hence persons so organized are disposed to
		<a class="pagenum" id="page23" title="23"> </a>materialism, and either doubt the existence of their psychic being, or
		are indifferent to it.</p>

		<p>On the other hand, those in whom the interior faculties predominate
		too greatly vividly realize their psychic life, but have more
		vague and feeble conceptions of material objects, including their
		own bodies, and attach undue importance to the imaginary and subjective
		in preference to the objective. The materialists and the
		illusionists, however, are not entirely composed of these two classes
		of subjective and objective thinkers. The majority consists of
		persons of moderate reasoning capacity, who simply follow their
		leaders.</p>

		<p>In making a critical distinction between the psycho-organic
		brain and non-psychic body, the former may be confined
		strictly within the cranium, leaving the exterior portions of the head
		as a part of the non-psychic body; but as they are more intimately
		associated with the brain than any part below the neck, this
		distinction is not important; and if the whole head, as the environment
		of the psychic brain, be grouped with it, it may not lead to
		any material error. The brain is intimately associated with the
		entire physical person by twelve pairs of cranial or cerebral nerves,
		and by the spinal cord, which descends from the base of the brain
		through a great foramen or opening midway between the ears, and
		while passing down the spinal column gives off thirty pairs of
		nerves.</p>

		<p>The cranial nerves are all for the head, except the <em>pneumogastric</em>
		or lung-stomach nerve, which belongs to the organs of respiration,
		voice, and digestion; and the spinal nerves are all for the body,
		except a few which ramify in the neck and in the scalp.</p>

		<p>The entire nervous system is so instantaneously prompt in conveying
		to the brain the impressions which originate feeling, and in conveying
		from the brain the nervous energies that produce voluntary
		motion and modify all the processes of life, that we feel as if we had
		sensation and volition in every part of the body; or, in other words,
		that our conscious existence was in the body; but we rationally
		know that the sensation and volition occur in the brain, for neither
		sensation nor voluntary motion can occur if the nervous connection
		with the brain is interrupted by compression and section, or if the
		brain itself be sufficiently compressed. When the brain is exposed
		by an injury of the cranium, the pressure of a finger suspends all
		consciousness and volition, making a blank in the life of the individual.</p>

		<p>Animal life resides in the nervous system alone, and its character
		is proportioned to the development thereof, of which the brain is the
		principal mass. A subordinate portion of the general life, however,
		is in the nervous system of the body, and in proportion as the brain
		declines in development the relative amount of psychic energy in
		the body is greater. Thus the body of the alligator after decapitation
		is capable of sensation and voluntary acts, such as pushing
		away an offending body with its foot. The character of the life in
		the body is explained by physiology and sarcognomy. Its universal
		<a class="pagenum" id="page24" title="24"> </a>presence is due to the universal diffusion of the nervous system,
		of which the accompanying figure, showing the location of the spinal
		cord and spinal nerves, will give a proper conception. In this figure
		the spinal cord, with its thirty pairs of nerves, eight cervical at the
		neck, twelve dorsal in the back, five lumbar in the loins, and five or
		six in the sacrum (between the hips), is seen descending from the
		base of the brain below the cerebellum (which is rather too large in
		engraving), and proceeding throughout the body until lost in fine
		ramifications which the microscope can scarcely trace, but which
		quickly inform us if they are touched or disturbed.</p>

		<div class="image">
			<a href="images/fig01.png"><img src="images/fig01-th.png" width="347" height="644" alt="Human nervous system from the back" /></a>
		</div>

		<p>It cannot properly be said that the spinal cord proceeds from the
		brain, nor on the other hand that the brain proceeds from the spinal
		cord, for they originate simultaneously in a soft, jelly-like condition
		<a class="pagenum" id="page25" title="25"> </a>in which the microscope cannot detect the latent structure, not as
		they are in the adult, but as they are in the fœtus in which they
		first appear, with a structure similar to that of the lowest class of
		vertebrate animals, the fishes.</p>

		<p>From this embryonic condition, in which there is very little
		resemblance to the adult brain, its progress has been carefully traced
		by many observers, but chiefly by Tiedemann, through all the
		stages of life before birth into the soft, infantile form of the human
		brain. Some knowledge of this embryonic growth is necessary to a
		correct understanding of the adult brain, its essential plan, its
		growth, and the correct estimate of its development.</p>

		<p>I have not found in our anatomical works what I consider a
		satisfactory exposition of this subject. Beginning as a student with
		Spurzheim’s anatomy of the brain, which ought to have been the
		clearest and most complete of all, I found it so obscure and unsatisfactory
		that until I had made many dissections I had no very clear
		understanding. I have never found any pleasure in the writings of
		Spurzheim. In more recent authors the anatomical details are very
		abundant indeed, and sufficient to tax the <em>memory</em> heavily, but without
		that system and philosophy which appeal to the understanding
		and make our conceptions satisfactory, as I hope to make them to
		my readers, who must have very incorrect conceptions of the plan
		of the brain, if they have relied upon the writings of Mr. Combe
		and his successors of the phrenological school, none of whom, so far
		as I am aware, have really understood cerebral anatomy.</p>

		<p>Let us approach the subject by taking an exterior and general
		view, then by tracing the embryonic growth of the brain, and the
		interior connections of its fibres, until we are fully prepared to judge
		of its development as it lies in the skull, and to understand the
		relation of each organ to all other portions. Then we can study its
		functions with a clear understanding of the relations of the organs
		to each other, which is the material basis of psychic science, and
		with full confidence in our ability to judge and compare living heads
		and skulls of man and animals.</p>

		<div class="illo_left">

		</div>

		<p>Let us take an exterior view by
		removing one half of the skull from
		the right side of the head. This
		enables us to see that the front
		portion of the brain rests above the
		sockets of the eyes, coming down in
		the centre as low as the root of the
		nose, but a little higher exteriorly.
		When we touch the forehead just
		over the root of the nose, our finger
		touches the lowest level of the front
		lobe, the seat of the intellect; but
		when we touch the external angle of
		the brow on the same level, we
		touch a process of bone, and our finger is fully half an inch below
		the level of the brain.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page26" title="26"> </a>In the posterior view we see that
		below the great mass of brain which
		is called the cerebrum there lies a
		smaller body, shaped much like a
		small turnip, called the cerebellum
		or little brain, separated from the
		cerebrum by a firm, horizontal membrane
		called the tentorium (covering
		the cerebellum), on which the cerebrum
		rests.</p>

		<div class="illo_right">
			<a href="images/fig03.png"><img src="images/fig03-th.png" width="191" height="240" alt="Head cutaway showing the brain: right rear." /></a>
		</div>

		<p>The position of the tentorium can
		easily be ascertained in your own
		head by the fact that where it crosses
		the median line there is a little projection
		of bone called the occipital knob, very prominent on some
		persons, barely perceptible on others. After locating the occipital
		knob, a horizontal line forward will give us the portion of the tentorium.
		When we carry this line forward just over the cavity of the
		ear, thus locating the tentorium, we easily recognize below it the
		rounded prominence on each side in which the two hemispheres or
		halves of the cerebellum lie, with a depression between them on the
		median line. To make these and other observations on the head
		(which no one should neglect), the hand should be placed firmly on
		the scalp, so that as it slides on the bone we feel the form of the
		skull beneath. In most persons a distinct depression will be felt
		along the line of the tentorium, separating the cerebrum and cerebellum—the
		cerebellum being located at the summit of the neck,
		and extending down about as low as the end of the mastoid process,
		which is the large, long prominence just behind the cavity of the
		ear.</p>

		<p>The cerebellum may be regarded as the physiological and the
		cerebrum as the psychic brain, for the cerebellum is void of intelligence
		and volition, but has important influences on the body. It
		may be considered, like the spinal cord, an intermediate structure
		between the controlling and conscious brain and the corporeal
		organs.</p>

		<p>The tentorium does not entirely separate it from the cerebrum,
		for anteriorly it is open to permit the passage of the fibres which
		connect the cerebrum with the spinal cord and the cerebellum,—fibres
		which pass up midway between the right and left ear, so that
		a bullet fired horizontally through from ear to ear would sever
		the connection of the cerebrum with the bodily organs, producing
		instant death. This will be understood by looking at the profile of
		the interior of the right hemisphere, on which we see the position of
		the pons and the medulla and their relation to the cerebrum by their
		ascending fibres. As these ascending fibres correspond to a position
		just above the cavity of the ear, and as they are the channels of all
		muscular impulses, the reader will perceive that breadth of head immediately
		above the cavity of the ear must be associated with muscular
		impulsiveness.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page27" title="27"> </a>The position of the cerebrum in the cranium may be best understood
		by sawing the head in two horizontally, taking out the brain,
		and looking down into the base of
		the skull, in which we see anteriorly
		a shelf for the front lobes, behind
		which are the cavities for the middle
		lobes, and behind that the rounded
		cavities for the cerebellum.</p>

		<div class="illo_right">
			<a href="images/fig04.png"><img src="images/fig04-th.png" width="213" height="230" alt="Cutaway of the bottom half of the skull, looking down from the top (no brain)." /></a>
		</div>

		<p>Thus the front lobe occupies the
		highest plane, resting on the vault
		of the sockets of the eyes, and
		extending back as far as the sockets.
		The middle lobe lies behind the
		sockets of the eyes and above the
		cavities of the ears, its base being as
		low as the bottom of the sockets of
		the eyes and corresponding nearly with the upper edge of the cheekbone,
		as it extends from the sockets to the side of the head just in
		front of the ears. In the posterior base of the skull, the reader will
		observe an opening (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">foramen magnum</em> or large foramen) through
		which the spinal cord ascends. The spinal cord is exposed in the
		neck below the foramen.</p>

		<p>Going back, we find the middle lobe rises higher, ascending over
		the cavity of the ear and resting upon the ridge of bone in which
		the apparatus of hearing is situated, thus reaching the level of the
		tentorium, on which the occipital lobe rests.</p>

		<p>The bones of the cranium seen by looking down into the basis of
		the skull, as above, are the frontal bone over the eyes, the sphenoid
		bone, behind the sockets of the eyes, extending from the right to the
		left temple, the temporal bones, forming the ridge that holds the
		apparatus of hearing, and extending up about two inches on the side
		head, and the occipital bone at the back, between the two temporals,
		meeting the sphenoid bone in the centre of the base. The cerebellum
		rests in the deep double concavities of the occipital bone, and
		the spinal cord ascends through the large opening (foramen magnum)
		in the middle of its base, assuming the form called the
		medulla oblongata.</p>

		<div class="illo_right">
			<a href="images/fig05.png"><img src="images/fig05-th.png" width="246" height="236" alt="Bony skull, with the lobes labeled. Left profile." /></a>
		</div>

		<p>When we fully understand this
		view of the base of the skull, let
		us look at it in profile, and observe
		the frontal bone connected by the
		coronal suture to the parietal and
		the parietal by the squamous or
		scaly suture to the temporal, and
		by the lambdoid suture to the
		occipital. The sphenoid or bat-wing
		bone appears in the temples by its
		wing, between the frontal and temporal,
		while in the centre of the
		base its solid body is between the
		frontal and occipital.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page28" title="28"> </a>The sphenoid bone is in contact with organs of sensitive delicacy,
		refinement, and inspiration, the occipital with organs of vital force,
		the temporal with organs of appetite, excitement, and force, the
		frontal with organs of intellect and refined benevolence, the parietal
		with the organs of virtue, amiability, self control, and general
		strength of character, which make a superior person.</p>

		<p>Modern anatomists do not divide the brain into front, middle, and
		occipital lobes as would seem most natural, by erecting vertical lines
		from their bases, but follow up the oblique courses of the convolutions
		so as to extend the front lobe into the upper surface of the
		brain, and extend the middle lobe from the middle of the upper
		surface backward into the region of Self Confidence, giving the name
		of temporo-sphenoidal to its lower portion behind the sockets of the
		eyes and over the ears, which name is taken from the temporal bone,
		that contains the apparatus of hearing, forming the middle of the
		basis of the skull, and the sphenoid bone, which lies just back of
		the sockets of the eyes, supporting the front end of the lower
		portion of the middle lobe, called temporo-sphenoidal.</p>

		<div class="image">
			<a href="images/fig06.png"><img src="images/fig06-th.png" width="577" height="494" alt="Left view of the brain, with parts labeled." /></a>
		</div>

		<p>The sphenoid bone thus sustains the region of Sensibility, while
		the temporal bone lodges the organs of the most sensual, selfish, and
		violent impulses, the action of which is downward into the muscular
		<a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29"> </a>and visceral organs of the body. The sphenoid bone as it extends
		up touches the base of the front lobe and of the Ideal region, where
		it assumes the name of Somnolence. (See the profile view of the
		cranium.)</p>

		<p>The upper portion of the middle lobe has been given the name of
		parietal, as it has a general correspondence with the parietal bones,
		while the occipital lobe has a general correspondence in position
		with the occipital bone, as will be seen by comparing the plan of the
		brain seen in profile with the engraving of the cranium.</p>

		<p>The <em>plan</em> of the brain is given, instead of an engraving of the
		actual convoluted surface, to simplify the study to the learner. An
		examination of the brain itself or of a good model offers at first sight
		such a vague and irregular mass of convolutions, differing so much
		in different brains, that any systematic arrangement would seem
		impossible. But by studying the subject more extensively and
		considering the structure of the simpler brains of animals, in which
		the complexity of the human brain is reduced to simpler forms, a
		mode of grouping and classifying the convolutions has been adopted
		by anatomists which is illustrated by the engraving, in which we
		see, not the numerous convolutions of a well developed human brain,
		but the groups in which they have been arranged by the aid of
		comparative anatomy.</p>

		<p>The front lobe is grouped into the superior, middle, and inferior
		convolutions, or groups of convolutions, and the ascending frontal;
		but the inspection of a brain would show an irregularity of forms in
		which a casual observer would be puzzled to trace this arrangement.</p>

		<p>The appearance of the brain, divested of its membranes, when we
		look upon its superior surface, is shown in the annexed engraving,
		in which it is presented as it lies in
		the head when the cranium and membranes
		are removed which form the
		rim of the figure. The front lobe is
		the upper portion, and the outline of
		the nose is just visible. In the full
		exposition of this subject hereafter
		in a larger work, I propose to show
		the exact seats of the various functions
		in the convolutions, which are
		much more irregular than the angular
		figures we make on the surface of the
		head to show the average positions of
		organs. Of course no intelligent
		person supposes the psychological maps and busts of the organs to
		be representations of the brain, or anything more than approximations
		to the true interior organology, which, however, do not lead
		to any great error, as adjacent portions of convolutions have very
		analogous functions.</p>

		<div class="illo_left">
			<a href="images/fig07.png"><img src="images/fig07-th.png" width="206" height="244" alt="Top cutaway of a skull, showing the brain. The nose of the head is at the bottom of the picture." /></a>
		</div>

		<p>When we place the brain on its upper surface and inspect the
		bottom, we observe at the back the cerebellum, which dips into the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30"> </a>neck, the middle lobe, which is over the ears and the side face, and
		the front lobe, which rests over the eyes.</p>

		<p>We observe posteriorly the medulla oblongata, on the face of which
		we may observe the crossing of the fibres, and on the side of which
		we observe the origins of many nerves. Above the medulla we
		observe the pons Varolii, just above which we observe the fibres
		ascending to each hemisphere under the name of <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">crus cerebri</em>, or
		thigh of the cerebrum. Next we see the optic nerves crossing on
		the median line, the olfactory nerve, running under the front lobe,
		which is separated by the fissure of Sylvius from the middle lobe.
		There is also a glimpse of the corpus callosum at its anterior end,
		obtained by pulling the front lobes apart at the median line.</p>

		<div class="image">
			<a href="images/fig08.png"><img src="images/fig08-th.png" width="491" height="568" alt="View of the (labeled) brain from below. Brain stem at the bottom of the picture." /></a>
		</div>

		<p>Let us next cut through the head exactly on the median line,
		dividing the right and left hemispheres, and look at the inner face
		of the right hemisphere. We observe that it has convolutions, just
		like the exterior surface, which do not join across the median line, but
		are separated from those of the left hemisphere by a firm membrane
		<a class="pagenum" id="page31" title="31"> </a>(an extension of the dura mater or principal investing membrane)
		called the falx, which is removed, leaving the convolutions in view.</p>

		<p>The reader will observe that it is only in the lower portion of the
		engraving that he sees any surfaces produced by cutting to separate
		the right and left halves of the brain. It is by these structures
		which are here divided that the right and left halves are connected,
		so that the whole brain is adapted to acting in a unitary manner.</p>

		<p>The first section we encounter as we pass down is that of the
		<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">corpus callosum</em>, a body of white fibre firmer than the external surface
		of the brain, and therefore called the corpus callosum or callous
		body, which consists of white nerve fibres gathered in from nearly
		all parts of the brain on each side and crossing the median line.
		We may regard it as a mass of representative fibres rooted in the
		soft substance of the convolutions or gray matter of the brain
		generally, and thus connecting across the median line the corresponding
		parts of the right and left brain.</p>

		<div class="image">
			<a href="images/fig09.png"><img src="images/fig09-th.png" width="541" height="437" alt="Left profile cutaway view of (labeled) brain." /></a>
		</div>

		<p>It must be borne in mind that the brain like the body is double, and
		that every organ is fully developed in each brain, so that no amount
		of injury or paralysis of organs would deprive us of any faculty,
		unless corresponding parts were destroyed in each hemisphere.</p>

		<p>The left brain governs the right half of the body, and the right
		brain governs the left half, the connecting fibres having their crossing
		(called decussation) in the spinal cord. Hence the left brain is
		usually more fully developed in the occipital and basilar regions than
		the right, in right handed people, as may frequently be detected by
		<a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32"> </a>a careful examination of the head, or an inspection of the interior
		the skull. The left brain, also, seems to have a general ascendency
		over the right; so that paralysis of speech is most generally produced
		by disease in the region of language on the left side.</p>

		<p>Whatever occurs on one side of the body is in relation to the
		opposite side of the head. Paralysis, if not dependent on the spinal
		cord, is dependent on the basilar region of the opposite side of they
		brain; and conditions of the right eye affect the lower margin of the
		left front lobe, in which the perceptive organs are situated.</p>

		<p>If we thrust our fingers into the brain immediately under the
		corpus callosum, pushing away the delicate little structure called
		the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">septum lucidum</em> (or translucent septum), and pressing down
		fornix (which is a thin, horizontal nerve membrane) we find that
		our fingers enter a cavity by pressing its walls apart, of which the
		corpus callosum is the vault or roof,—a cavity which may be explored
		back and forth, far into the interior of the occipital lobe
		within an inch of the surface, and far into the front lobe, near the
		surface of the frontal convolutions, as well as downwards and forwards
		into the bottom of the middle lobe (the part called temporo-sphenoidal).
		These extensions of this great cavity or ventricle are
		called the anterior and posterior horns (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">cornua</em>) and the descending
		horn (<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">cornu</em>).</p>

		<p>Their importance arises from the fact that in these ventricles of
		the right and left sides of the brain a watery fluid, effused from the
		blood, called serum, exists, which also extends downward along the
		spinal cord, and which has to do with the pressure and equilibrium
		of the various parts. When there is a strong pressure of blood to
		the brain on account of its unusual activity, especially in the activity
		of the emotions, the serum of the ventricles and also in the substance
		of the brain is absorbed, and the brain acquires a more
		compact texture, which is found in all persons of strong mentality,
		the brain being hardened by exercise, as well as the muscles. But
		when the action of the brain is feeble, and the blood in an impoverished
		condition, there is a greater tendency to the exudation of
		fluid; the substance of the brain is thereby softened, and serum, to
		the extent of one or more ounces, is frequently found in the ventricles,
		especially when the brain is much impaired by disease of its
		substance. In some cases of hydrocephalus pints of serum are
		effused, distending the brain and head enormously, and in many
		cases of insanity the ventricles and membranes of the brain are
		distended with serum. “Pritchard on Insanity” speaks of this
		distention of the ventricles, which were “very full of serum” in
		twenty-nine out of a hundred cases, and “in twenty-three ready to
		burst,” and “in ten among twenty-four melancholies astonishingly
		distended.” Dr. Spurzheim dissected a case of hydrocephalus,
		child of eighteen months, with two and a half pounds of water in
		the membranes of the brain; and James Cardinal, who died at the
		age of thirty years in London, had a pint of water in the lateral
		ventricles, and about nine pints between the brain and its membranes.</p>

			<h3 class="title">College of Therapeutics.</h3>

			<p>The large amount of scientific and therapeutic
			knowledge developed by recent discoveries, but not
			yet admitted into the slow-moving medical colleges,
			renders it important to all young men of
			liberal minds—to all who aim at the highest rank
			in their profession—to all who are strictly conscientious
			and faithful in the discharge of their
			duties to patients under their care, to have an
			institution in which their education can be completed
			by a preliminary or a post-graduate course
			of instruction.</p>

			<p>The amount of practically useful knowledge of
			the healing art which is absolutely excluded from
			the curriculum of old style medical colleges is
			greater than all they teach—not greater than the
			adjunct sciences and learning of a medical course
			which burden the mind to the exclusion of much
			useful therapeutic knowledge, but greater than
			all the curative resources embodied in their instruction.</p>

			<p>The most important of these therapeutic resources
			which have sometimes been partially
			applied by untrained persons are now presented
			in the College of Therapeutics, in which is taught
			not the knowledge which is now represented by
			the degree of M. D., but a more profound knowledge
			which gives its pupils immense advantages
			over the common graduate in medicine.</p>

			<p>Therapeutic Sarcognomy, a science often demonstrated
			and endorsed by able physicians, gives the
			anatomy not of the physical structure, but of the
			vital forces of the body and soul as located in every
			portion of the constitution—a science vastly more
			important than physical anatomy, as the anatomy
			of life is more important than the anatomy of
			death. Sarcognomy is the true basis of medical
			practice, while anatomy is the basis only of operative
			surgery and obstetrics.</p>

			<p>Indeed, every magnetic or electric practitioner
			ought to attend such a course of instruction to
			become entirely skilful in the correct treatment of
			disease.</p>

			<p>In addition to the above instruction, special
			attention will be given to the science and art of
			Psychometry—the most important addition in
			modern times to the practice of medicine, as it
			gives the physician the most perfect diagnosis of
			disease that is attainable, and the power of extending
			his practice successfully to patients at any
			distance. The methods of treatment used by
			spiritual mediums and “mind cure” practitioners
			will also be philosophically explained.</p>

			<p>The course of instruction will begin on Monday,
			the 2d of May, and continue six weeks. The fee
			for attendance on the course will be $25. To
			students who have attended heretofore the fee will
			be $15. For further information address the
			president,</p>

			<p class="sign">JOSEPH RODES BUCHANAN, M. D.<br />
			<span class="address name">6 James St., Boston.</span></p>

			<p>The sentiments of those who have attended these courses
			of instruction during the last eight years
			were concisely expressed in the following statement,
			which was unanimously signed and presented
			to Dr. Buchanan by those attending his last
			course in Boston.</p>

			<p>“The undersigned, attendant upon the seventh
			session of the College of Therapeutics, have been
			delighted with the profound and wonderful instructions
			received, and as it is the duty of all who
			become acquainted with new truths of great
			importance to the world, to assist in their diffusion,
			we offer our free and grateful testimony in the
			following resolutions:</p>

			<p>“<em>Resolved</em>, That the lectures and experiments of
			Prof. Buchanan have not only clearly taught,
			but absolutely demonstrated, the science of Sarcognomy,
			by experiments in which we were personally
			engaged, and in which we cannot possibly
			have been mistaken.</p>

			<p>“<em>Resolved</em>, That we regard Sarcognomy as the
			most important addition ever made to physiological
			science by any individual, and as the basis
			of the only possible scientific system of Electro-Therapeutics,
			the system which we have seen
			demonstrated in all its details by Prof. Buchanan,
			producing results which we could not have believed
			without witnessing the demonstration.</p>

			<p>“<em>Resolved</em>, That Therapeutic Sarcognomy is a
			system of science of the highest importance, alike
			to the magnetic healer, to the electro-therapeutist,
			and to the medical practitioner,—giving great
			advantages to those who thoroughly understand it,
			and destined to carry the fame of its discoverer to
			the remotest future ages.”</p>
